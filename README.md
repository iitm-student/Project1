Data scraping was done via the GitHub API, using the python library, requests, to establish a connection with the API.
The most interesting fact I realised is that the number of repositories isn't stringly correlated with follower counts, thus proving that quality trumps quantity.
Actionable Reccomenedation based on this data would be to prioritise quality of qork of frequency of posting or quantity.
