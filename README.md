Data scraping was done via the GitHub API, using the python library, requests, to establish a connection with the API.
The most interesting fact I realised is that the number of repositories isn't strictly correlated with follower counts, thus proving that quality trumps quantity.
Actionable Reccomendation based on this data would be to prioritise quality of work over frequency of posting or quantity.
